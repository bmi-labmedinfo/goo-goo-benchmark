# goo-goo-benchmark

Here we present GOO-GOO *(Good Old ML vs. Generalist Out-Of-the-Box models)*, an initiative to assess the true potential of Foundation Models on medical tasks without hype. Our goal is to establish a clear, 
unbiased standard that assists medical researchers in choosing between traditional algorithms and modern generalist models.

Paper submitted to AIME 2026 - Ottawa

We compare classical ML models (Logistic regression and Random Forest) and pre-trained Foundation Models for tabular data on publicly available medical datasets
